Welcome to the first chapter of our Python workshop! This chapter introduces you to the fundamentals of Python programming.

**Learning Objectives**

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand what Python is and why it's popular
- Install Python and Jupyter Notebook on your system  
- Write and execute your first Python programs
- Navigate the Python development environment

***************
What is Python?
***************

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991[1]. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

Key Features
============

Python offers several advantages for new programmers:

- **Simple syntax**: Python code reads almost like English
- **Versatile**: Used in web development, data science, AI, and automation
- **Large community**: Extensive documentation and third-party libraries
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Why Choose Python for Data Science?
-----------------------------------

Python has become the go-to language for data science because:

- Rich ecosystem of data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Interactive development with Jupyter notebooks
- Integration with machine learning frameworks

***********************
Setting Up Your Environment
***********************

Let's get your Python environment ready for the workshop.

Installing Python
==================

Follow these steps to install Python on your system:

**For Windows Users**

1. Visit https://python.org/downloads
2. Download the latest Python 3.x version
3. Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH"
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing: ``python --version``

**For macOS Users**

1. Install using Homebrew: ``brew install python3``
2. Or download from the official website
3. Verify with: ``python3 --version``

Installing Jupyter Notebook
============================

Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment perfect for learning Python:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install notebook

To start Jupyter Notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

   jupyter notebook

This opens a browser window where you can create and run Python code interactively.

*******************
Your First Program
*******************

Let's write your first Python program to get familiar with the basics.

Hello, World!
=============

Create a new Jupyter notebook and enter this code in a cell:

.. code-block:: python

   print("Hello, Python Workshop!")
   print("Welcome to programming!")

Press **Shift + Enter** to run the cell. You should see:

.. code-block:: none

   Hello, Python Workshop!
   Welcome to programming!

Interactive Input
=================

Try this interactive program:

.. code-block:: python

   name = input("What's your name? ")
   print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}!")

This demonstrates:

- Variable assignment (``name = ...``)
- User input (``input()`` function)
- String formatting (f-strings)
- Output (``print()`` function)

********************
Hands-On Activities
********************

Complete these exercises to practice what you've learned:

Exercise 1: Personal Introduction
=================================

Create a program that asks for your name, age, and favorite subject, then displays a personalized message.

.. note::
   
   Try using f-strings for formatting: ``f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!"``

Exercise 2: Simple Calculator
=============================

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for two numbers
2. Calculates their sum, difference, and product
3. Displays all results clearly

*******
Summary
*******

In this chapter, you accomplished several important milestones:

✅ **Installed** Python and Jupyter Notebook on your system  
✅ **Executed** your first Python programs  
✅ **Learned** basic input/output operations  
✅ **Practiced** with hands-on exercises  

**Key Concepts Covered**

- Python installation and setup
- Jupyter Notebook environment
- Basic syntax and operations
- Interactive programming concepts

**What's Next?**

In Chapter 02, we'll dive deeper into Python data types, variables, and basic operations that form the foundation of all Python programs.

.. tip::
   
   Keep your Jupyter notebook open and experiment with the code examples. The best way to learn programming is through practice!
